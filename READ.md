## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
1. **Flask Framework:** 
   - Setting up routes, rendering templates, and handling HTTP methods.
   - Understanding the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.

   - Working with Flask's SQLAlchemy ORM to interact with databases.

3. **User Authentication:** 
   - Building forms for user registration and handling input validation.
   - Storing and retrieving user data securely.

4. **Dynamic Templates with Jinja:** 
   - Creating reusable templates and injecting dynamic content.
   - Extending base templates to reduce code redundancy.

5. **Project Management:** 
   - Organizing code into meaningful directories (e.g., `static`, `templates`, `instance`).
   - Writing clean, modular, and readable Python code.

6. **GitHub Workflow:** 
   - Uploading projects to GitHub for version control and sharing with others.
   - Writing detailed `README.md` files to document the project.
